# Advanced SQL in Google BigQuery

## Introduction

Now that you've solidified your SQL skills in Weeks 1 and 2, let's level them up while learning a new tool: Google BigQuery. This will prepare you to efficiently run queries on big data, and to do so in a production environment like you might see in your work.

## Objectives

Perform advanced SQL queries using Google BigQuery

## Main Activity

We recommend completeing the following sections from Kaggle's [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) and [Advanced SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql) courses. These courses teach SQL in Jupyter Notebooks using Python. We anticipate that these will take about 5 hours to complete:

1. [Getting Started With SQL and BigQuery](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/getting-started-with-sql-and-bigquery)
2. [As & With](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/as-with)
3. [Joins & Unions](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/joins-and-unions)
4. [Analytic Functions](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql)

If you have trouble completing the assigned sections, we recommend coming back to this after doing more supplemental activities from SQL Weeks 1 and 2, and completing the full Kaggle [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) course.

## Supplemental Activities

If you have already completed these activities or have additional time, here are more activities we recommend.

1. For more about Google BigQuery specifically, complete the last two sections of the Kaggle [Advanced SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql) course. These should take about 3 hours.
2. For more practice with challenging queries, complete the problems in [The Best Medium-Hard Data Analyst SQL Interview Questions](https://quip.com/2gwZArKuWk7W). These should take about 5 hours.

## Summary

You've now completed all SQL content in this track. Congrats!
